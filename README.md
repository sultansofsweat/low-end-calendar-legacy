# Low End Calendar (LECal)
Simple calendar software that actually works. Started as a pet project when I realized that there are no good, well supported calendar suites that aren't also filled with unnecessary features. All I wanted was to be able to post events for everyone else to see.

What you see is what you get. All files here are at least sometimes tested, but they may not be. If you're looking for an actual stable calendar, check out the releases.
